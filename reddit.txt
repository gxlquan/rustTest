1.GGG Turned off the Ability to CREATE watchstone imprints, but left the ability to USE EXISTING watchstone imprints to restore Sextant Uses - so now the groups with the Pre-Patch Banked Imprints can continue mirror printing without fear of competition from others !

2.That's the reason why imprinting / splitting should be nuked out of beastcrafting if GGG doesn't plan to disable it on new league content. This is just getting out of hand. We need an imprit / split limited to stuff that can be equipped. Thanksfully it's not the worse league since printing winged scarabs is different than printing raw currencies and have a much lower impact on the economy.

Oh btw, splitting is also getting used to print money in the league by a few guys / a group. I don't mind giving it away since I don't profit from it and seeing the market getting cornered would just be funny. Basically all you need is an ilvl 85 blizzard crown. Get the base by farming rituals in T18 maps using +1 level watchstones, once you get it, split the base over and over to get multiple copies. Enchant copies you intend to sell so the buyers can't split it, and sell each copy 3-5 ex while cornering the market. Your cost per copy is 30c for the beast split + 3c for the enchanted fossil. At bare minimum you get 2.5 ex of profit per copy.
It's pretty cheap to do and really low effort. Copies sell pretty fast.
